## What is this?
A personal experiment where I wore a CGM for 30 days and compared the impact of what I ate on my blood sugar and subjective feelings of energy.

## Why?
Because I am interested to see the impacts of various foods on my blood sugar, particularly comparing similar foods such as oatmeal vs bread. I am also interested in correlating glucose spikes and crashes with my subjective energy levels.

## How?
I wore a [continuous glucose monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor), specifically a Dexcom G7. In the US, these are available by prescription only, however it is possible to get a prescription as a non-diabetic for general health and wellness purposes. I am not diabetic. Because I am not diabetic, this is not covered by insurance and it's something I paid out of pocket for. Please ensure that the supply of CGMs in your local area are readily available for people with diabetes before considering obtaining one as a non-diabetic.
