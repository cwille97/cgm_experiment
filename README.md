## What is this?
A personal experiment where I wore a CGM for 30 days and compared the impact of what I ate on my blood sugar and subjective feelings of energy.

## Why?
Because I am interested to see the impacts of various foods on my blood sugar, particularly comparing similar foods such as oatmeal vs bread. I am also interested in correlating glucose spikes and crashes with my subjective energy levels.

## How?
I wore a [continuous glucose monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor), specifically a Dexcom G7. In the US, these are available by prescription only, however it is possible to get a prescription as a non-diabetic for general health and wellness purposes. I am not diabetic. Because I am not diabetic, this is not covered by insurance and it's something I paid out of pocket for. Please ensure that the supply of CGMs in your local area are readily available for people with diabetes before considering obtaining one as a non-diabetic.

## My starting stats
Labs were measured on 2024-02-09
* Weight: 200 pounds (90kg)
* Height: 5'10" (177cm)
* [Fasting glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level): 84 mg/dL
* [A1c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin): 5.6%
* [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) (SGPT): 32 IU/L
* [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) (SGOT): 20 IU/L
* [Insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin): 8.7 uIU/mL

## General experimental controls
For this experiment I'm only interpretting measurements from the morning. This is because a person's blood sugar is going to be at a fairly stable baseline after fasting all night while sleeping. I will break the fast with these meals. Based on when I typically eat dinner, this will be after ~12 hours of fasting. I will avoid eating any subsequent food until my blood sugar has returned to baseline after the meal. Additionally, I will avoid exercise before or after the meal for several hours in order to avoid any blood sugar impacts, unless explicitly stated otherwise as part of that experiment (i.e. white rice fasting vs white rice fasting right after exercise). What's documented in the data is exactly what I'm eating for breakfast, no more or less, except for water.
