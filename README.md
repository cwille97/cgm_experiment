## What is this?
A personal experiment where I wore a CGM for 30 days and compared the impact of what I ate on my blood sugar and subjective feelings of energy.

## Why?
Because I am interested to see the impacts of various foods on my blood sugar, particularly comparing similar foods such as oatmeal vs bread. I am also interested in correlating glucose spikes and crashes with my subjective energy levels.

## How?
I wore a [continuous glucose monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor), specifically a Dexcom G7. In the US, these are available by prescription only, however it is possible to get a prescription as a non-diabetic for general health and wellness purposes. I am not diabetic. Because I am not diabetic, this is not covered by insurance and it's something I paid out of pocket for. Please ensure that the supply of CGMs in your local area are readily available for people with diabetes before considering obtaining one as a non-diabetic.

## My starting stats
Labs were measured on 2024-02-09
* Weight: 200 pounds (90kg)
* Height: 5'10" (177cm)
* [Fasting glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level): 84 mg/dL
* [A1c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin): 5.6%
* [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) (SGPT): 32 IU/L
* [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) (SGOT): 20 IU/L
* [Insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin): 8.7 uIU/mL

## General experimental controls
For this experiment I'm only interpretting measurements from the morning. This is because a person's blood sugar is going to be at a fairly stable baseline after fasting all night while sleeping. I will break the fast with these meals. Based on when I typically eat dinner, this will be after ~12 hours of fasting. I will avoid eating any subsequent food until my blood sugar has returned to baseline after the meal. Additionally, I will avoid exercise before or after the meal for several hours in order to avoid any blood sugar impacts, unless explicitly stated otherwise as part of that experiment (i.e. white rice fasting vs white rice fasting right after exercise). What's documented in the data is exactly what I'm eating for breakfast, no more or less, except for water.

My muscles were likely consuming quite a bit of glucose which blunted the spike and flattened the curve
| 2024-02-24 | Honey Nut Cheerios right after weight lifting (30 minutes) | 41 | 12 | 12 | 151 | Not noticeably high energy like yesterday (cheerios before gym) but don't feel like my workout was hindered | ![honey nut cheerios 2-24](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/6d060720-48d7-44a5-8e83-af497d200dca) | ![honey nut cheerios cgm 2-24](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/e93c6e1f-4d32-48b3-9f88-c03f7a2a6e0c) | Glucose spike is clearly blunted by exercise. Before vs after doesn't seem to matter for weight lifting
| 2024-02-25 | Honey Nut Cheerios right before riding the stationary bike (30 minutes) | 41 | 12 | 12 | 171 | Felt good biking after eating | ![honey nut cheerios 2-25](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/42e85dad-4fc8-477c-9b44-6d9abf08bca8) | ![honey nut cheerios cgm 2-25](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/1054d3e1-6620-42b5-b852-6a75611e87d5) | Seems like biking right after didn't lower the peak, but it did seem to cause blood sugar to return to base line more quickly than if I hadn't done any exercise
| 2024-03-02 | Plain cheerios and going rock climbing right afterwards | 41 | 0 | 0 | 170 | Trying the non-sweetened plain cheerios after several days of honey nut made them taste really bland. You really get used to the sweetness on the Honey nut and it stops feeling as sweet | | <img width="281" alt="3-2 cgm" src="https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/c7333726-6867-42fc-8c6d-72edb9150ae3"> | Rock climbing seems comparable to biking
| 2024-03-03 | Honey Nut Cheerios with a whole avocado, and two eggs (with a splash of sriracha) | 41 (just cheerios) | 12 (cheerios) | 12 (cheerios) | 169 | Intention with this meal was to see if a large amount of fat and protein with the carbs would slow the absorption of carbs | ![honey nut cheerios 3-3](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/12d7dc9c-3aa1-4193-b691-bbebe2076aa5) ![eggs 3-3](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/aeec1afd-f982-48f9-b690-6cadc244629b) ![avocado 3-3](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/14df0573-6c1c-4642-9713-2b843446f122) | ![3-3 meal cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/0d881248-ffed-46b4-8e64-1bd4a8c17e4c) | The extra fat and protein didn't seem to have a profound impact on blood sugar in presence of the same bolus of carbs
| 2024-03-04 | Strawberry Poptarts | 96 | 30 | 30 | 205 | Felt a bit of a sugar crash from these but not too bad | ![poptarts](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/26be098d-cc15-47e5-af3d-1e6e4247d1a5) | ![poptarts cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/9b2e975a-eb1a-4b1c-be80-751978889986) | This is more added sugar and overall simple starch than the other meals so unsurprisingly, the biggest spike yet |
| 2024-03-04 | Salad with grilled chicken and homemade ranch dressing | 250 | 0 | 0 | 120 | Very filling from all the fiber and chicken. Note that this experiment was not fasted (Poptarts this morning) although I did wait for my blood sugar to recover to approximate baseline | ![salad](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/41497b3d-a0e3-4c32-9566-828c1db0392e) | ![salad cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/faf96c92-b484-434a-a63c-9aa251f9fdae) | Even though the salad was mostly carbs, aside from the grilled chicken breast which is protein, there's so much fiber it seems to be causing a very slow and minimal blood sugar impact |
| 2024-03-04 | Pasta with garlic shrimp and zucchini | 550 | 1 | 1 | 159 | Little bit of added sugar from the oyster sauce but most carbs here are the pasta | ![shrimp pasta](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/da3ed407-6388-492b-855c-617f85f238fa) | ![shrimp pasta cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/5ed98e74-a6de-4aa2-bfe2-a14f300c03ff) | Moderate spike, probalby from the white pasta. My energy levels felt good in the gym shortly after this |
| 2024-03-05 | Old fashioned oats with 2% milk | 40 (just the oats) | 1 | 0 | 162 | Relatively filling and okay for my energy levels but not great | ![oats](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/e0606cad-00fb-40b1-b357-304e8cd999b5) ![oatmeal](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/86575d0a-fafa-44d3-b79d-cccf30c03111) | ![oatmeal cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/7e4e2eef-ab5d-4fa0-a12e-971f6cd2a8dc) | Even though these are whole grains, the fiber doesn't prevent the moderate impact of blood glucose levels. Maybe the "rolling" process makes the starch more easily available for your body to absorb as opposed to eating a whole raw oat grain with the husk intact? |
| 2024-03-07 | Naked Green Machine | 450 mL | 53 | 0 | 166 | Tasty but lots of calories for how little it fills you up | ![green machine nutrition label](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/21d28669-ed91-4f17-913a-f73750ea07ab) ![green machine](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/071c6e5c-fdfe-462c-823e-b2094fc35b04) | ![green machine cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/1b071794-03b9-4f2c-8f54-871a175dddef) | I actually expected a larger spike here given that there's practically nothing but carbs in here (almost 25% of daily recommendation!) |
| 2024-03-08 | Coca Cola | 20 fl oz | 65 | 65 | 184 | I expected a big energy crash from drinking this on an empty stomach but actually felt totally fine | ![coke](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/0b43d653-cd5b-4c4f-a5b0-5bc2c8d7eb05) | ![coke cgm](https://github.com/cwille97/cgm_experiment/assets/24487628/fab57a8b-e246-4878-8f4e-aaefb1f586da) | Not much bigger of a spike than juice if you factor in about 10% more sugar (spike is about 10% bigger as well) |
